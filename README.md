# Mizu
# Running Code
When cloning the repositor make sure to use the line below to get all the submodules.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TomyBDev/Mizu
```

To generate all the files required for running the code yourself, you can run **"GenerateProjects.bat"** found in the root directory. This will run a python script to install premake to run the premake file. 

If that doesn't work just go to https://premake.github.io and download premake and put the premake5.exe in **/vendor/bin/premake/** then run **GenWin.bat** in scripts.
